Two data Files were provided to analyze the PyCity schools. One file contained complete student data, while the other contained complete school data. 
The analysis includes:
    - DIstrict summary
    - School summary
    - Highest and lowest performing schools
    - Math and reading scores by spending, school size, and school type.

Conclusions Drawn
 Charter schools have a greater overall passing percentage than district schools, approximately 40% greater. Charter schools hold the top five spots for overall passing, while district schools hold the bottom five spots. Charter schools can maitain a higher overall passing rate while having a lower budget per student than district schools.

 The size of schools has a significant impact on overall succes percentage. Small (<1000>) and medium (1000-2000) schools have approximately 90% overall passing percentage while large (2000-5000) schools are only at 58% overall passing rate.
